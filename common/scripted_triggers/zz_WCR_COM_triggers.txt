# Triggers dedicated to driving seamless compatibility with Community Outfit Mod
#
# Provides two scripted triggers COM should expect to have defined when WCR is active that WCR will use to signal intent
# to enable or disable an outfit.
#
# ==================================================================================================================== #
#
# COM_WCR_enable_outfit
#     When true, signals intent to have an outfit be enabled; i.e., WCR is not trying to apply an outfit and is
#     expecting COM to provide one. 
#
# COM_WCR_disable_outfit
#     When true, signals intent to have an outfit be disabled; i.e., WCR is trying to apply its own outfit and wants
#     COM to not apply a potentially conflicting outfit.
#
# Both triggers should be implemented directly in the modifier block of an outfit. No other checks with regards to
# country, character/pop, etc. are needed by COM and WCR will handle that on its end. Best usage for both triggers would
# be to use them in separate modifier blocks away from the normal logic (unless if otherwise acceptable). Either trigger
# returning false should be interpreted as WCR not wishing to interrupt the functionality of COM, and trigger logic
# should be set up such that either trigger returning false has zero impact on any outfits the triggers are used in.
