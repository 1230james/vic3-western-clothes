# Western Clothes: Redux

For Victoria 3

## Overview

**Western Clothes: Redux** (WCR) is a mod for [Victoria 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) and a continuation of [Snori's Adopt Western Clothes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2882557699) mod (AWC). Active development has ceased with AWC and Snori has passed the torch on to me.

With WCR, countries that start off as unwesternized at the beginning of the game will receive access to a decision that allows them to westernize once certain conditions have been met. Upon taking the decision, the characters and pops in the westernizing country will begin wearing European clothing.
